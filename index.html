    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <div>
      <p>
	Hi! I'm Kevin Hu, an incoming first year medical student at
	the Yale School of Medicine.
      </p>

      <p>
	I enjoy thinking about where medicine, math, philosophy, and religion
	meet. A lot of my time ends up in computational genetics, bioethics,
	philosophy of math, and sleeping.
      </p>

      <p>
	This is a first go at a website of my own design. Stay tuned for more content ahead.
